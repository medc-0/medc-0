## About

I’m **Omed**, a frontend-focused developer and student based in Germany.

I mostly work with **JavaScript / TypeScript** and modern frontend tooling to build clean, responsive web interfaces.  
Alongside that, I enjoy exploring **lower-level programming** through hobby projects in **C, C++, Assembly**, and **Python** — mainly to understand what’s happening under the hood.

I care about fundamentals, readable code, and building things that make sense.
